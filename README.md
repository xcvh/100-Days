# 100 Days of SwiftUI

I begun learning Swift once already via Codecademy and the all in one approach was nice enough, but somehow I got stuck after their first bigger project and I learned about Paul Hudson's approach since and thought that it might fit me the most. I also feel like he is very invested in the course and always keeping it up to date. In the excursions folder i put little explorations of data structures, algorithms and programing paradigms.
