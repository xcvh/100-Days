// MARK: Checkpoint 6:

// To check your knowledge, hereâ€™s a small task for you: create a struct to store information about a car, including its model, number of seats, and current gear, then add a method to change gears up or down. Have a think about variables and access control: what data should be a variable rather than a constant, and what data should be exposed publicly? Should the gear-changing method validate its input somehow?

struct Car {
    let model: String
    let numberOfSeats: Int
    private(set) var currentGear = 0
    
    mutating func shiftUp() {
        if currentGear < 10 {
            currentGear += 1
            print("Gear is now: \(currentGear)")
        } else {
            print("You are already in maximum gear!")
        }
    }
    
    mutating func shiftDown() {
        if currentGear > 0 {
            currentGear -= 1
